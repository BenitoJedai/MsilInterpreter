MSIL Interpreter
===============

MSIL interpreter for a school project for subject Runtime Systems. It uses features from C# 6.0 and is compiled with Roslyn available in the latest Visual Studio 14 CTP version (currently 4).

The key target is to make it work with some decent code first (we can choose from different options like SAT solver, regex matcher, grep, LISP interpreter, ...) and focus on optimizations if there's enough time to do so.
