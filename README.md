MSIL Interpreter and runtime
===============

MSIL interpreter and runtime for a school project for subject Runtime Systems. The key target is to make it work with some decent code first (we can choose from different options like SAT solver, regex matcher, grep, LISP interpreter, ...) and focus on optimizations if there's enough time to do so.
